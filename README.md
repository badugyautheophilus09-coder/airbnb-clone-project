# Importance of User-Friendly Design in a Booking System
# 1.Ease of Use

-If the booking process is simple and intuitive, users can quickly find available options, select what they need, and confirm their booking without confusion.

-A complicated or cluttered interface often makes users abandon the process midway.

# 2.Faster Bookings

-A clean layout with clear steps (choose → review → pay → confirm) helps users complete reservations in less time.

-This is especially important for people booking on mobile devices.

# 3.Higher Conversion Rates

-A user-friendly system reduces friction, meaning more users finish the booking.

-This directly increases sales or reservations for the business.

# Importance of Identifying Design Properties in a Mockup
# 1.Clarity of Vision

-Design properties (like colors, typography, spacing, buttons, and layout) define the overall look and feel of the design.

-Identifying them makes sure the development team clearly understands the designer’s vision.

# 2.Consistency

-When you know the exact properties (e.g., font size 16px, button color #1E90FF), you avoid inconsistencies across pages.

-Consistency builds trust, professionalism, and better user experience.

# 3.Smooth Collaboration

-Developers, designers, and stakeholders can communicate better when design properties are identified.

For example, instead of saying “make the button blue,” you say “use #007BFF with 8px border-radius.”
